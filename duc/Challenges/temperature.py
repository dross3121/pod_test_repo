# The formula for converting between fahrenheit and celsius is to first subtract 32, then multiply by 5/9. Can you do the following in python?
# Convert a temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
# Save this to a variable called celsius_100, and use print() to print out the value
# Is the resulting temperature you get an integer or float? How do you know?
# Convert a temperature of 0 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
# Save this to a variable called celsius_0, and use print() to print out the value
# Convert a temperature of 34.2 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
# Do this one all in one print statement without saving any variables

celsius_100 = (100-32)*5/9)
print(celsius_100)

celsius_0 = (0-32)*5/9
print(celsius_0)
