\n They sent a package of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis. 
\n Those three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram. 
\ But, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, and company have put together an incredible season. 
\n Los Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA. 
\n The Lakers ended the season atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14. 
\n They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league. 
\n Davis proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoff√≠s last year. 
\n Los Angeles was a dominant club on both sides of the ball and are in a position to have another successful year next season.'''
