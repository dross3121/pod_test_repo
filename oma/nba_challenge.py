But, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, and company have put together an incredible season.\
Los Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA.\
The Lakers ended the season atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14.\
They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league.\
Davis proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoff√≠s last year.\
